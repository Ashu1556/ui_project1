              Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only
              sold shoes. Today, we still sell shoes â€” as well as clothing,
              handbags, accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very
              best customer service, customer experience, and company culture.
              We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to
              simultaneously deliver happiness to customers, employees, vendors,
              shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainable way.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started
              selling shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a service
              company that just happens to sell _______.
